Essentially, RChASM treats different protocols separate analyses anyway. input data read R data frame/tibble, ChASM run one command: runChASM(). user must decide parameters, default values calculated using large-scale simulation study can used. Nevertheless, parameters can adjusted. minSamplesPerProtocol: minimum number samples required calculate required Dirichlet distribution parameters. encourage minimum least 30 samples (per protocol), although functional minimum 23 exists estimating parameters Dirichlet prior distribution. min_reads: minimum number reads sample can used estimating Dirichlet parameters. urge caution calling karyotypes samples less 60,000 reads, makes sense use lower threshold estimating prior distribution read counts. max_reads: maximum number reads sample can used estimating Dirichlet parameters. Sometimes read counts high-coverage samples behave strangely, likely due sample reaching complexity, made worse high-coverage samples poor preservation. p_contamination: proportion samples study expect return significant contamination estimates. can found simply running favourite contamination estimator data set, seeing proportion (although consider XX+XY contamination , conservative estimate contamination perform well). show_plot: TRUE/FALSE setting decides see x-rate vs y-rate clusters used train sex chromosomal aneuploidy prior distribution. encourage user make sure see two reasonable clusters, representing XX XY. , may need adjust min_reads max_reads, may samples variability samples (although unlikely distribution three-dimensional). printMissingIDs: TRUE/FALSE setting decides see samples missing merge two aneuploidy types: sex chromosomal autosomal, just many.
